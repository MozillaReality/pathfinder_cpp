# pathfinder_cpp
c++11 implementation of PathFinder, based on https://github.com/pcwalton/pathfinder
This is a WIP and likely to see more extensive refactoring.  A rust version is likely to follow.

The aim is to create a simple, self contained library that can be easily embedded
in browsers and other applications that need GPU accelerated text and svg rendering.
